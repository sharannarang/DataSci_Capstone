# DataSci_Capstone

This word prediction application was developed as a part of the Capstone project in the Data Science Coursera Specialization. To use the application and learn more about the functionality, please visit:

https://sharan.shinyapps.io/word_prediction/

The code is organized as follows:

* en_US/Presentation: Contains the presentation file created at the end of the project. To view the presentation, please visit http://rpubs.com/sharannarang/48288
* en_US/accuracy: Contains the file to predict accuracy of the application over a number of predictions. Used for cross validation and estimating test set error.
* en_US/word_prediction: Conatins 4 files which form the bulk of the web processing
  * cleaning_function.R: Contains the code to clean the input text
  * predict.R: Contains the functionality to make a prediction after the input is cleaned.
  * ui.R: Implements the UI for the website
  * server.R: Interacts with the UI and prediction functions to generate the prediction and display the output.
* en_US/capstone_proj.md: Exploratory analysis report due at mid-point of the project.
* en_US/scratch.R: Contains most of the code to create the models from the training data. (Contains some scratch work as well)
* en_US/helper.R: Some helper functions used by scratch.R

Please feel free to contact for any questions/comments.
